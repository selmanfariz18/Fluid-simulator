Fluid Simulation

Fluid simulation is a fun and relaxing app that converts your smartphone into a liquid space where colors flow and respond to the touch of your finger on the screen. This is an app that uses the touch sensitivity of your screen to allow you to create a whole galaxy of animated and fluid colors.
